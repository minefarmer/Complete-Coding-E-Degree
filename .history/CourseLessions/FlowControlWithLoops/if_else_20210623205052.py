"""[If/Else]
Focus of this section is on controlling the flow of my data and coding with loops

If and else statements are key and our introduction into logical programming

If something is TRUE
    Then complete option A
Else (aka it's FALSE)
    Then complete option B

These can be nested as well for more complex applications
